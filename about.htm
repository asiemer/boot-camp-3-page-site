			<p>My name is Andrew Siemer. I was born and raised in California.  I left the Army in 1994 and spent most of my 4 years in the Army stationed in Ft Lewis Washington.  Most of that time was with 2nd Ranger Battalion.  I got out of the military in 1998 and moved down to Los Angeles with my frist wife and first child.</p>

			<p>Once In LA I started looking for a job.  For two weeks I hung wire in commercial buildings.  I quickly realized that I was not going to enjoy doing that sort of work for very long.  And instead decided to enroll in ITT Tech to study Auto CAD.  That was my first introduction to computers.</p>

			<p>With computers I quickly found that I loved to tinker on the network, build computers, and start writing code.  It didn't take me very long to start tinkering around on the school network and get into a little bit of trouble.  But I was hooked!</p>

			<p>I immediately started buying computer books and my computer consulting life took off from there.</p>

			<p>After spending 15 or so years consulting in LA, meeting my current wife, and having 5 more children - I moved to Austin Texas.  This was always the place for me.</p>

			<p>We bought a ranch and relocated our family and horses there.  We now have 60 pigs.  Hundreds of chickens.  3 peacocks. 5 geese. 30 ducks. 4 donkies. 1 horse. 2 ferrets. 1 parrot. 7 dogs. 15 cats. And probably more.</p>

			<p>Professionally I have been a consultant for a very long time.  Here in Austin I have been a technical architect, chief architect, director of engineering, trainer, advisor, etc.</p>

			<p>My family and I really love living in Texas.  A friend gave me a shirt when I got here:</p>

			<blockquote>I wasn't born in Texas, but I got here as quick as I could!</blockquote>
